## Introduction

KOOMPI Fi-Fi is a technology that connects millions of people to the internet, which means that they can connect to useful websites or social media. The internet is changing the way people and businesses communicate on a daily basis.

Today, we have wifi hotspots in coffee shops, hotels, and airports, and some parts in provinces. However, some remote areas don't have a secure and affordable internet connection. 

The KOOMPI Network Development team researched and developed KOOMPI Fi-Fi for those that don't have internet access for an affordable price. 
The internet allows small and large businesses to facilitate their work, utilize their time and store their files securely. 

Students may not be able to afford any internet hotspot despite their growing need to learn and research. KOOMPI Fi-Fi also provide secure storage and internet connection. Nowadays, we already deployed this project to Saang School. In the future, we hope more schools can connect to KOOMPI Fi-Fi.
